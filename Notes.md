Piece of data = Piece of state
JavaScript front-end frameworks exist because keeping a user interface in sync with data is really hard and a lot of work.

React is an extremely popular, declarative, component-based, state-driven JavaScript library for building user interfaces, created by Facebook.
-Components are the building blocks of user interfaces in React.
-We build complex UIs by building multiple components and combining them.
-Declarative syntax called JSX. Tells React what a component should look like based on current data/state.
-React is abstraction away from DOM: we never touch the DOM.
-JSX: a syntax that combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as referencing other components.
-State(data) - React reacts to state changes by re-rendering the UI.
-React is a library, not a framework.
-Next.js and Remix are frameworks built on top of React
-Created in 2011 and open-sourced in 2013

    -React is really good at 2 things:
        -Rendering components on a webpage (UI) based on their current state.
        -Keeping the UI in sync with stat, by re-rendering (reacting) when state changes.

State is necessary when we want to update anything on the screen

create-react-app - Complete starter kit for React applications - Everything is already configured: ES Lint, Prettier, Jest Babel etc. - Uses slow and outdated technologies - Good for tutorials or experiments - DO NOT USE for real-world apps

Vite - Modern build tool that contains a template for setting up React applications - Need to manually set up ESLint and others - Extremely fast hot module replacements (HMR) and bundling

React team now advises using a React framework like Next.js or Remix

npx create-react-app@5 pizza-menu - @5 is to create project with version 5 - cd to project folder - npm run start (npm start)

-All React does is take components and drawn them onto UI
-React renders a view for each component and all views together makes up UI
-Component is a piece of UI
-Each component has data, JS logic and appearance.
-Build complex UIs by building muliple components and combining them
-Components can be reused, nested inside each other, and pass data between them.
-Create a component tree to map relations between components

Component is a function that starts with uppercase (App())
Functions(Components) must start with capital letter and have a return (can be null, usually JSX)
Components contain its own Data, Logic and Appearance

JSK is:
HTML sent from JS.
A delecarative syntax to describe what components looks like and how they work (Appearance)
An Extension of JS that allows us to embed JavaScript, CSS and React components into HTML

Each JSX element is converted to a React.createElement funtion call with BABEL
Can use React without JSX if you wanted

JSX works essentially like HTML, but we can enter JavaScript mod using {}
We can place JS expressions inside {}. For example, using variables, create arrays or objects, [].map(), ternary operator. Statements are not allowed (if/else, for, switch)
JSX produces a JS expression.
We can place other pieces of JSX inside {}
Can write JSX anywhere inside a component (in if/else, assign to variables, pass to functions)
A piece of JSX can only have one root element. If you need more, use <React.fragment> (or the short <>)

Imperative vs Declarative
Imperative (JS) ("How to do things")- Manual DOM element selections and DOM traversing. Step-by-step DOM mutations until we reach the desired UI
Declarative (React) ("What we want") Describe what UI should look like using JSX, based on current data. React is an abstration away from DOM; we never touch the DOM. Instead, we think of the UI as a reflection of the current data.

Strict mode will cause components to render twice, can see that when using "alert" JS function.

Props:
Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components (down the component tree)
Essential tool to configure and customize components (like function parameters)
With props, parent components control how child components look and work
Anything can be passed as props: single values, arrays, objects, functions, even other components

Props are read-only. They are immutable. This is one of React's strict rules
Props is data coming from the outsize, and can only be updated by the parent component
State is internal data that can be updated by the component's logic

A component should not mutatate any data that we write outsize it's function scope.
React uses one-way data flow. Easier to understand and debug. More performant.
